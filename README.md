<h1>About Grocery Management</h1>

This Python code enables users to create two types of grocery lists: the first collects items and their individual prices, computing the total cost; the second allows users to input multiple items with quantities and prices, printing a detailed breakdown of each item's purchase. Additionally, it provides functions to compare two purchases and identify price differences for shared items or items unique to each list. This versatile script enhances grocery shopping organization and decision-making, making it a useful tool for managing shopping expenses.
